## Introduction
<details>
   <summary>Cryo_READ is a computational tool using deep learning to automatically build full DNA/RNA atomic structure from cryo-EM map.  </summary>
DNA and RNA play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, where the three-dimensional (3D) structure provides critical information to understand molecular mechanisms of their functions.  Although an increasing number of structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with proteins are determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), structure modeling for DNA and RNA is still often challenging particularly when the map is determined at sub-atomic resolution. Moreover, computational methods are sparse for nucleic acid structure modeling.

Here, we developed a deep learning-based fully automated de novo DNA/RNA atomic structure modeling method, CryoREAD. CryoREAD identifies phosphate, sugar, and base positions in a cryo-EM map using deep learning, which are traced and modeled into a 3D structure. When tested on cryo-EM maps determined at 2.0 to 5.0 Ã… resolution, CryoREAD built substantially accurate models than existing methods. We have further applied the method on cryo-EM maps of biomolecular complexes in SARS-CoV-2.
</details>

## Overall Protocol 
<details>
1) Structure Detection by deep neural network CryoREAD networks;   
2) Tracing backbone according to detections;   
3) Fragment-based nucleotide assignment;  
4) Full atomic structure modeling.

## Installation
<details>

### System Requirements
CPU: >=8 cores <br>
Memory (RAM): >=50Gb. For maps with more than 3,000 nucleotides, memory space should be higher than 200GB if the sequence is provided. <br>
GPU: any GPU supports CUDA with at least 12GB memory. <br>
GPU is required for CryoREAD and no CPU version is available for CryoREAD since it is too slow.

### Build atomic structure without sequence information
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=[Map_Path] -M=[Model_Path] --contour=[half_contour_level] --gpu=[GPU_ID] --batch_size=[batch_size] --resolution=[Map_Resolution] --no_seqinfo --refine
```
[Map_Path] is the path of the experimental cryo-EM map, 
<br>[Model_Path] is the path of our pre-trained deep learning model, 
<br>[half_contour_level] is 0.5* contour_level (suggested by author) to remove outside regions to save processing time, 
<br>[GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference,
<br> [batch_size] is the number of examples per batch in the inference (we used 8 with a 24GB GPU), 
<br>[Map_Resolution] is the resolution of the deposited maps.

"--refine" should be removed if you can not successfully install Phenix/coot correctly, which may result in nucleotides that do not satisfy some geometry and chemical constraints.

The automatically build atomic structure is saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/Refine_cycle[k].pdb] in pdb format, here default k is 3. However, it may fail if your dependencies are not properly installed, then you may only find Refine_cycle1.pdb or Refine_cycle2.pdb.

#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/21051.mrc -M=best_model --contour=0.3 --gpu=0 --batch_size=4 --resolution=3.7 --no_seqinfo --refine
```

```
[Map_Path] is the path of the experimental cryo-EM map, 
<br>[Model_Path] is the path of our pre-trained deep learning model, 
<br>[Fasta_Path] is the path of the input fasta file about sequence information, 
<br>[half_contour_level] is 0.5* contour_level (suggested by author) to remove outside regions to save processing time, 
<br>[GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference, 
<br>[batch_size] is the number of examples per batch in the inference (we used 8 with a 24GB GPU), 
<br>[rule_soft] specifies the assignment rule, default is 0 to use the strict assignment assembling rule, 
<br>[Map_Resolution] is the resolution of the deposited maps.
<br>[num_thread] specifies the number of CPUs used for fragment-based sequence assignment.

"--refine" should be removed if you can not successfully install Phenix/coot correctly,which may result in nucleotides that do not satisfy some geometry and chemical constraints.



#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/21051.mrc -M=best_model -P=example/21051.fasta --contour=0.3 --gpu=0 --batch_size=4 --rule_soft=0 --resolution=3.7  --refine --thread 4 
```
The automatically build atomic structure is saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/Refine_cycle[k].pdb] in pdb format, here default k is 3. However, it may fail if your dependencies are not properly installed, then you may only find Refine_cycle1.pdb or Refine_cycle2.pdb. Modeled structures without considering sequence information are also saved as [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/CryoREAD_noseq.pdb] (without refinement). Meanwhile, structures only considering the sequence information without connecting gap regions are saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/CryoREAD_seqonly.pdb] (without refinement) for reference.
<br>Please adjust --thread based on your available CPU numbers (more is better).

### Structure Information Predictions by CryoREAD.
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=[Map_Path] -M=[Model_Path] --contour=[half_contour_level] --gpu=[GPU_ID] --batch_size=[batch_size] --prediction_only 
```
[Map_Path] is the path of the experimental cryo-EM map, 
<br>[Model_Path] is the path of our pre-trained deep learning model, 
<br>[half_contour_level] is 0.5* contour_level (suggested by author) to remove outside regions to save processing time, 
<br>[GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference, 
<br>[batch_size] is the number of examples per batch in the inference (we used 8 with a 24GB GPU). 

The predicted probability maps are saved in [Predict_Result/(map_name)/2nd_stage_detection] with mrc format. It will include 8 mrc files corresponding to 8 different classes.

#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/21051.mrc -M=best_model --contour=0.3 --gpu=0 --batch_size=4 --prediction_only
```

<summary>Structure Refinement Pipeline in CryoREAD (if you only want to refine your structure)</summary>

### Structure refinement
The full refinement pipeline involving Phenix and coot is also available for refinement-only purposes. 
```
python3 main.py --mode=1 -F=[input_structure_pdb] -M=[input_map_path] -P=[output_dir]
```
This refinement pipeline can work for any given structure (not limited to DNA/RNA) and a corresponding map.
<br>[input_structure_pdb] is the path of the input structure in pdb format, 
<br>[input_map_path] corresponds to the input map path. 
<br>[output_dir]: the directory you specify to save the outputs during refinement process. The final output Refine_cycle3.pdb will be generated in this directory.

#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=1 -F=example/6v5b_drna.pdb -M=example/21051.mrc -P=refine_test
```
This will refine the input structure according to density and output the refined structure in [refine_test] directory.
